For this assignment you must create a chatbot in Java using a GUI.

This chatbot must be able to respond to 3 specific keywords. In addition to this, the chatbot must keep running until the keyword "exit" is typed. Make sure that it can search for keywords correctly ('brexit' and 'exit' are different and the chatbot must realize this)

This assignment is due January 13th. You need to submit your java code (the class file) and the executable .jar file. This code must be your own original work. Honor code applies to submitting code online.
